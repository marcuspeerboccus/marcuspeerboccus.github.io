EXPERIENCE 
CERTIFICATION: NVIDIA & UFIT: FUNDEMENTALS OF DEEP LEARNING, NOVEMBER 2024 
4 week in person course delivered by NVIDIA & UFIT, covering the theory behind neural networks, and 
applications of Deep Learning with 7 guided projects, and a final assessment using PyTorch 
PROJECT: COVID MODEL, SKILLS: SCIKIT LEARN, REGRESSION ANALYSIS, MAY 2024 
Analyzed a dataset from the Mexican government that contained health risk factors and COVID-19 
infection status of over 1 million patients. Developed 3 machine learning models using sci-kit learn to 
predict patient mortality given COVID infection status, and also COVID infection status given patient 
demographics (selected using Principal Component Analysis). Used cross validation to train and test 
random forest, decision tree, and logistic regression models. Models visualized with a confusion matrix 
and response operator curve using matplotlib and seaborn packages. 
PROJECT: NUTRITIENT SORTER, SKILLS: C++, CSV PARSING, BIG O NOTATION, DECEMBER 2023 
Parsed CSV from the FDA with nutrient/vitamin values of over 5000 foods into a data structure: a vector 
of pairs containing a string (food name) and a double (nutrient/vitamin value). User would receive an 
output with foods highest in the nutrient/vitamin they selected. Efficiency of the sorting algorithms 
were compared in a report using big O notation, and the chrono library in C++.
