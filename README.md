### Project: Car Sales Forecasting üöó  
**[Github Link](https://github.com/marcuspeerboccus/Q50-Forecasting)**

*Skills: Facebook Prophet, scikit-learn (XGBoost, LASSO, Random Forest), Hyperparameter Tuning | December 2024*  
- Extracted 10 years of monthly sales data for a popular sedan using CV techniques and aggregated it with economic data from multiple sources  
- Implemented Facebook's Prophet time series forecasting model with one covariate  
- Compared Prophet results with XGBoost, Random Forest, and LASSO models, all using a full lagged covariate set  
- Performed iterative hyperparameter tuning for Prophet and LASSO models, reducing out-of-sample MAPE (average % deviation from true value) for Prophet from 87% to 16%  
- Achieved MAPE ranges from 22% (LASSO) to 11% (Random Forest), demonstrating model effectiveness for forecasting 2024 data using 2013-2023 data 
- Utilized the parsimonious LASSO model to identify the most important covariates impacting sales
